If having this error:
Error: pg_config executable not found.

      pg_config is required to build psycopg2 from source.  Please add the directory
      option:

          python setup.py build_ext --pg-config /path/to/pg_config build ...

      or with the pg_config option in 'setup.cfg'.
      'psycopg2-binary' package instead.

Install 'psycopg2-binary' rather than 'psycopg2'

delete all types where need to give type union e.g. 'str|float'
